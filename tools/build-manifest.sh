#!/usr/bin/env bash
# build-manifest.sh — emit a SHA-256 manifest of every file in the deployed
# bundle so users can verify that what they're running on monero-web.com
# matches the corresponding git tag.
#
# Usage:
#   ./tools/build-manifest.sh           # write MANIFEST.txt with all hashes
#   ./tools/build-manifest.sh --check   # verify the live site matches MANIFEST
#
# This is the trust anchor that makes "open source" mean something for a
# hosted wallet. Without it, users have to take on faith that what's running
# at monero-web.com matches the public GitHub repo. With it, anyone can run
#
#   curl -sf https://monero-web.com/MANIFEST.txt | sha256sum -c
#
# from a clone of the repo and verify byte-for-byte that nothing has been
# silently substituted.
